This project scrapes posts and comments from the r/CompetitiveTFT subreddit and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze community sentiment around in-gameaugments. It exposes a FastAPI endpoint that returns structured Reddit data with sentiment tags (e.g., positive/negative), allowing users to understand how players feel about specific augmentations and consider he sentiment surrounding specific augments during the selection phase.
