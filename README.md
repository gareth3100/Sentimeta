This project scrapes posts and comments from the r/CompetitiveTFT subreddit and applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze community sentiment around in-game augments. It exposes a FastAPI endpoint that returns structured Reddit data with sentiment tags (e.g., positive/negative), allowing users to understand player sentiment about specific augments during the selection phase.
